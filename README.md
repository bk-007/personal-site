# Bryce's Link Page

This is my personal link page — a single-file HTML site with a little motion, color, and attitude.  
No frameworks, no build tools, no nonsense. Just open it and it works.

It’s a one-pager with:
- My photo
- A few links (Instagram, LinkedIn, GitHub)
- A subtle animated border and some background shimmer

That’s it.  
Simple, light, and maybe a little too proud of itself for being one file.

Enjoy.
